This repository contains the frontend application for a modern, interactive resume builder. It is designed as part of a next-generation "Resume Building & Career Ecosystem" for students and professionals.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this application provides a multi-step editor that allows users to input their information and see it reflected in a live resume preview. The app supports multiple templates, color themes, and provides a direct-to-PDF download feature.

(Note: You should replace the link above with a real screenshot of your application. A good screenshot would show the editor on one side and the live preview on the other.)
